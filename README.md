# Building a Simple Content-Based Recommender System for Movies and TV Shows

With over 13,000 titles on Netflix, there is an overwhelming number of entertainment options to choose from! As such, this learning project aims to create a simple content-based recommender system that can recommend TV shows and movies to a user. Of course, this is far more basic compared to industry standards but it is a fun personal project to work on!

We would take in an input which is a user's favourite show/movie and pick up the top 10 films that are most similar to his/her personal favourite. Here, we explore 2 possible ways to identify similar items: (1) A simple similarity measure - Cosine Similarity (2) Clustering Algorithm - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Data Set used: Kaggle Netflix Movies and TV Shows (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
